# Search-Rename-Move-Files-From-CSV
Script looks through csv file of filenames, finds files (also within subfolders), and renames and moves file to specified directory

The moveandrename.py file utilizes the pandas and numpy python libraries to load a csv file as a pandas dataframe, search files for existing file names, then move the files to new folders and rename them based on information in the dataframe.  This process fully removes the original files from their original location.
